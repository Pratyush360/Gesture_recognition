# Gesture_recognition

The training data consists of a few hundred videos categorised into one of the five classes. Each video (typically 2-3 seconds long) is divided into a sequence of 30 frames(images). 
These videos have been recorded by various people performing one of the five gestures in front of a webcam - similar to what the smart TV will use. 
Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie
 

Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).
